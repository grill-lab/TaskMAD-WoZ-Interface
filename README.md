# TaskMAD-WoZ-Interface

A UI for Wizard of Oz experiments. 

This document describes a modified version of the application for use with [this version of TaskMAD](https://github.com/grill-lab/TaskMAD/tree/radboud_branch). 

## Overview

The key differences from the original version:
 * the functionality for generating a set of UI buttons from a spreadsheet is now not used
 * instead user responses are generated by sending requests (through the TaskMAD backend) to a 3rd-party API which in turn calls an LLM API
 * step changes are now controlled by the LLM API responses based on the state of the conversation
 * message sending rules are now applied:
   * some responses from the LLM API will be sent automatically while others may be edited before sending
   * conversational turns always consist of a single message from each user
   * the wizard must initiate the conversation

## Configuration and deployment

The recommended method to configure and deploy the WoZ application is by using the Docker deployment script packaged with TaskMAD. For instructions on using this script, please see [the TaskMAD README file](https://github.com/grill-lab/TaskMAD/blob/radboud_branch/README.md).
